This repository contains code for every exercise from the tutorial part of the famous Programming paradigms course conducted by dr inż. Zdzisław Spławski, as well as most of the exercises by dr inż. Michał Szczepanik from the lab part.

The code should only be used as a quick reference and preferably not as a lazy cheat sheet.

## Structure
The code is contained in the [tuts](src/tuts) catalog for the execercises related to the tutorial course, and in the [labs](src/labs) catalog for the lab exercises.
Each file in these catalogs is associated with the exercise list number and contains the exercises from that specific list.
Each exercise is numbered and has a short description, should the order or the content of the actual exercises change in the future.

According to the requirements, most of the exercises from the tutorials are written in both OCaml and Scala.
Sometimes, though, this wasn't the case.

Because of Java restrictions, each class is contained in a separate file.
To prevent name collisions, Java exercises are usually enclosed in their own catalog, and these are then grouped in a catalog for the whole exercise list.

The instructions for the exercise lists are available in Polish in the [instructions](https://github.com/karolbelina/pp/tree/master/instructions) directory.

## Notes
- I am not responsible for anybody who fails the course as a result of mindless copying the code from this repository.
- Pull requests are welcome. This code is a group project anyway.
